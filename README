Itty-bitty Android root-only app that activates permanent Bluetooth discovery

The basic concept is that you need to call BluetoothAdapter.setScanMode with the correct
arguments.  It is a private method, so reflection is required.  Furthermore, the permission
required to call this method is WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS, so the application MUST be installed
in /system and it must be signed.

Once you build the app you can sign it with some key (it doesn't really matter what, could be self-signed)
jarsigner -verbose -keystore my-release-key.keystore AlwaysDiscoverable/bin/AlwaysDiscoverable.apk mykeyname
